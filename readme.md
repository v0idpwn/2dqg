2dqg (2D Quiz Generator) is a minimal 2d quiz creating app. I developed it while doing my first steps with Flask. This probably shouldn't be used but is an interesting proof of concept.

To run the application, open up a command prompt and type the following: 

1. set FLASK_APP=server.py
2. set FLASK_DEBUG=1
3. flask initdb
4. flask run
